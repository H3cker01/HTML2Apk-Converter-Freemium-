# html2apk BY Hekcer

> Convert any HTML/CSS/JS project or URL into a signed Android APK — no Android Studio, no Java, no setup.

html2apk is a self-contained Windows executable. Download it, run it, build your app. Everything needed — build tools, Java runtime, signing tools — is bundled inside.

## Download

**[⬇ Download html2apk.exe](../../releases/latest)**

No installation required. Just download and run.

## What it does

html2apk wraps the real Android SDK build pipeline (`aapt2`, `zipalign`, `apksigner`, `bundletool`) into a simple GUI. You provide your HTML/JS/CSS — either as a local folder or a URL — and it produces a properly built, signed Android app.

## Usage

1. **Download** `html2apk.exe` from [Releases](../../releases/latest)
2. **Run** it — no installation, no setup
3. Fill in your **App Settings** (name, package ID, URL or local HTML path)
4. Adjust SDK versions, orientation, permissions, and icon as needed
5. Check **Signed** for a release-signed APK
6. Check **Also AAB** if you also want an Android App Bundle
7. Click **⚒ Build APK**

Output files appear in an `output/` folder next to the exe:

```
output/
├── MyApp-v1.0-signed.apk
└── MyApp-v1.0-signed.aab   ← only if "Also AAB" was checked
```

## FAQ

**Does it need Java installed?**
No. The exe bundles its own minimal Java runtime.

**Does it need Android Studio or the Android SDK?**
No. All required build tools are embedded in the exe.

**Can I use my own signing keystore?**
The bundled debug keystore works for sideloading and testing. For Play Store publishing with your own key, see the source code — the signing step is straightforward to adapt.

**What's the difference between APK and AAB?**
APKs can be sideloaded directly onto a device. AABs are required for Google Play Store submission.

**What Android versions does the output support?**
By default, Min SDK 21 (Android 5.0) through Target SDK 36 (Android 16). Both are configurable in the GUI.

**Does it work on macOS or Linux?**
The exe targets Windows only.
